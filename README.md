## Deployment and workflow

This project is deployed through github pages and follows a simplified agile gitflow methodology:

-   Each day of the project being considered one 'sprint'.
-   Main branch is preserved as the deployed and live branch, whilst all development work will be conducted on feature branches.
-   Code deployments to the live project environment will only available through a pull request to main. This enables a CI/CD approach.
-   All feautures must be tested on the 'develop' branch before being considered a release candidate to main.
    This ensures the deployed project maintains a stable codebase, and provides a scaleable workflow should the project scope increase and more developers were required to join the project.
